    "Regression searches for relationships among variables. Generally, in regression analysis, you consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that at least one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.[1]\n",

    "Linear regression is one of the simplest and widely used regression techniques. There are two kinds of Linear Regression Model:<br>\n",

    "* Can be used to predict what the price of a product will be in the future, whether prices will go up or down.\n",
