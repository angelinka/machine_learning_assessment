    "`scipy.stats` is the SciPy sub-package which is mainly used for probabilistic distributions and statistical operations. SciPy stands for Scientific Python it is a very powerful open-source library and it's being used to perform  mathematical, scientific and engineering computations. It is build upon `NumPy` library and was created by the same person who created NumPy - Travis Olliphant with help from the open source community. \n",
