## Objectives

This repository was created to complete the project for Machine learning and Statistics module at ATU by utilising Jupyter notebooks.
There are two main objectives for this assessment:
- Demonstrate how to perform a t-test on the data set using `scipy.stats`
- Demonstrate how to perform linear regression on the data set using `scipy.stats`

## Explore

Repository Contents:

1. gitignore
2. README.md
3. regression.ipynb - jupyter notebook explaining simple linear regression and performing data analysis using `scipy.stats`
4. ttest.ipynb -  jupyter notebook explaining t-test and performing data analysis using `scipy.stats`

Folders:
- data - contains datsets used for analysis
- img - contains image used in the notebook
- practicals - contains some of the exercise which were included with the lectures

## How to install the notebook

You need to run this notebook in python environment (please refer to packages and dependencies in requirements.txt file) the easiest way to do that is to install Anaconda
1. Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). If not using Anaconda can install packages via ***pip install / homebrew install*** (Example: pip install matplotlib).
2. Download [cmder](https://cmder.net) if using Windows. Or use Terminal if on macOS or Linux.

## How to run the notebook

1. Open terminal / cmder.
2. Run command `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from command line. It's a web application which runs on your local machine (you will be able to see the server running in Terminal/cmder). To stop the application running press control+c and then type 'y' to confirm.
3. The browser page should open up automatically. Select the file you would like to view.

You can also start `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from Anaconda-Navigator.

You can view the **t-test** notebook in static or dynamic form by clicking the following images:
